# IEGems Target Frequency Response Ver. F

Comparing to version E, this target add the bass punch trick from DCA Stealth introduced by Dan Clark himself in a CanJam workshop. Specifically, a 3db bump was added between 100hz and 150hz. This target successfully increases the sense of "punch" and dynamic of Andromeda 2020.
